## Reinforcement Learning On Mountain Car and an Atari Game

In this project I have tried Reinforcement Learning on two Open AI games . One is Mountain Car Game and another is AirRaid, an Atari Game.

For the Mountain Car game , I have used Q Learning ALgorithm . The Agent needs to earn -110 reward . We have achieved the reward by running upto 30000 episodes. For the simple Q learning algorithm, I have taken help from [this blog](https://medium.com/emergent-future/simple-reinforcement-learning-with-tensorflow-part-0-q-learning-with-tables-and-neural-networks-d195264329d0) . The Video of Full training is [here](https://youtu.be/hClI5zFJlxI) . Please notice that the video is full training , so it is very large . Skip to last 1-2 minutes to watch the final Result

For the AirRaid Game, I have used Deep Q Network with Experience replay . For the Architecture I have used the architecture mentioned [here](http://neuro.cs.ut.ee/demystifying-deep-reinforcement-learning/) .
